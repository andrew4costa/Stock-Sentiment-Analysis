# Stock-Sentiment-Analysis

The aim of this project was to explore the news concerning different companies using BeautifulSoup and Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK). News headlines were scored by a sentiment, ranging from: negative (neg), neutral (neut) and positive (pos) using vader.

Each sentiment for each company for the news article on a certain date was then plotted to observe any trends that might've occurred.
